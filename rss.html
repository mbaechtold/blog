<h1>Back To Square One</h1>
<p>More than one year ago I thought it would be a great idea to start some kind of technical blog
based on <em>Octopress</em> but I never managed to write more than one article.</p>
<p>It only was last weekend I stumbled upon <em>Tinkerer</em>, a static blog generator
based on <em>Sphinx</em>, the Python documentation generation system. I was
hooked immediately and within 5 minutes I had setup a project, installed <em>Tinkerer</em> and created my first
blog post:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>mkproject my-tinkerer-blog  <span class="c"># Powered by virtualenvwrapper</span>
pip install tinkerer
tinker --setup
tinker --post <span class="s2">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The last command created a file where I could put the content of the post in <em>reStructedText</em> format.
A final command was necessary in order to build the static HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>tinker --build
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All that was left was copying the generated HTML to my Github pages repository and push it to Github.</p>
<p>Now that I switched to a system I know more than the last one I even might
write a bit more. Weâ€™ll see.</p>
