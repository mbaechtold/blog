Back To Square One
==================

.. highlight:: bash

More than one year ago I thought it would be a great idea to start some kind of technical blog
based on *Octopress* but I never managed to write more than one article.

It only was last weekend I stumbled upon *Tinkerer*, a static blog generator
based on *Sphinx*, the Python documentation generation system. I was
hooked immediately and within 5 minutes I had setup a project, installed *Tinkerer* and created my first
blog post::

    mkproject my-tinkerer-blog  # Powered by virtualenvwrapper
    pip install tinkerer
    tinker --setup
    tinker --post "Hello World"

The last command created a file where I could put the content of the post in *reStructedText* format.
A final command was necessary in order to build the static HTML::

    tinker --build

All that was left was copying the generated HTML to my Github pages repository and push it to Github.

Now that I switched to a system I know more than the last one I even might
write a bit more. We'll see.
